\label{req}
In order to conduct this research we need multiple server instances that run a webserver instance which respond to both versions of HTTP, HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 \cite{http2-imp}. That instances will run on our student servers and on microinstances, using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) \cite{amazon} infrastructure to cover real life scenarios (e.g. RTT variances using different regions). Furthermore web client software that has already implemented HTTP/2 will be used \cite{mozilla}.
