This research will mainly focus on the major improvements of the HTTP/2 protocol compared to HTTP/1.1 and to investigate the general user experience when visiting a website (e.g. page loading time) and possible impacts on the infrastructure under high load circumstances. In order to have consistent results the same configuration will be used on different platforms implementing HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1. 
\\
The conducted measurements are focussing on the new features of the protocol and are not intended to be a full benchmark of the protocol.
