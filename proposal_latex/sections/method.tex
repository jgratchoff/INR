First, several webserver instances will be implemented in order to have multiple HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 enabled environments. Second, those instances will serve  Web sites that have different characteristics (number of files, size of files) and different geographical locations to cover e.g. different Round Trip Times (RTTs). Finally we will conduct benchmarking based on that infrastructure to outline the improvements or drawbacks HTTP/2 provides in comparison to HTTP/1.1.
