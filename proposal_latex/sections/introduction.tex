\section{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}
Recently, the specification for the new HTTP protocol HTTP/2 (and HPACK), the successor of the HTTP/1.1 protcocol has been formally approved by the IESG and will become an RFC standard soon. The main focus during the development period of the protocol was to improve the performance, and thus provide a better user experience. The performance improvement is mainly based on how the packets are sent over the wire within a HTTP/2 session. HTTP/2 data is sent in binary format and is based on a multiplexing mechanism that allows a single connection for parallelism.  \\
There are already web client and server implementations that support the final HTTP/2 specification.
