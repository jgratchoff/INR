\section{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}
Recently, the specifications for the new HTTP protocol HTTP/2 (and HPACK), the successor of the HTTP/1.1 protcocol have been formally approved by the IESG and will become an RFC standard soon. The main focus during the implementation period of the protocol was to improve the performance, and thus providing a better user experience. The performance improvement is mainly based on how the packets are send over the wire within a HTTP/2 session. HTTP/2 data is send in binary format and is based on multiplexing mechanism that allows a single connection for parallelism.  \\
There are already web client and server implementations that support the final HTTP/2 specification.
