In this section the measurement results are presented and analysed. First the HTTP header sizes for HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 are compared against each other. Secondly, the results of the RTT measurements and the actual performed rate of requests per second with a growing number of concurrent clients are presented and discussed for each measurement separately. Finally, an overview of the server utilization during the measurements is given for network bandwidth, CPU utilization and TCP sockets.
